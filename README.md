### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With 3 years of experience in distribution management and program development, I have developed key skills in communication, marketing, market analysis, and project management. These skills, combined with the technical training acquired during a 9-week Data Science & AI bootcamp at Le Wagon, form a solid foundation for my new orientation in data science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Gen AI, playing with Open AI tools. My goal is to make a tool for my lawyer's friend.
- ðŸ˜Ž I love outdoors, yoga, good wine
